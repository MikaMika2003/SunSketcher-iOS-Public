<strong>Note:</strong> This repo does not include any confidential code. The missing code is important for building this project for it to completely work as intended. I cannot provide the rest of the code currently since this project is still on going. 

## About the Project
This was a major citizen science project funded by NASA where students at Western Kentucky University were able to build an app that would assist with measuring the true shape of the Sun. How would this be possible with a simple mobile app? Well, since we already know the shape of the moon and since the moon completely covers the Sun during a total solar eclipse, we can use it to find the Sun's shape. Using the latitude, longitude and altitude of the phone where each image is taken and with the presence of Bailey's Beads it is all made possible. I encourage you to visit our website to find out more about our work.

We gained 25.7k downloads for the iOS app and 7.7k for the Android app. From these numbers, we received thousands of data (photos along with their metadata) that have been analysed bringing us one step closer to finding the true shape of the Sun. We hope to move forward with the project, learning from our first use of it during the April 8th, 2024 eclipse, and use it for future total eclipses. Next total eclipse will be in Spain in 2026!!!

## Facts about my part in this project:
- It took me from September 2023 to March 2024 (not including December 2023 as I took time off for the winter break) to complete this app.
- I did not know how to code in Swift or anything about iOS development until this project.
- I am no longer part of the team as of December 2024 due to my graduation from the university.
